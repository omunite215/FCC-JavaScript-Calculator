## Welcome to My Repository!!

### This is a Markdown Previewer Project on React!!

### I faced problems in making logic of : 
- dot elimination in case of consecutive input decimals.
- input of multiple operators

### I took help of a tutorial from DwinaTech Youtube channel
      
[DwinaTech](https://www.youtube.com/@DwinaTech-coding)

The project is hosted on Netlify : https://fccmarkdownpreviewerbyom.netlify.app/

I am not removing react's readme files because, it will help you using react as well. Thanks!!

Problem Statement is given below: 
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an = (equal sign) with a corresponding id="equals".

User Story #2: My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: id="zero", id="one", id="two", id="three", id="four", id="five", id="six", id="seven", id="eight", and id="nine".

User Story #3: My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: id="add", id="subtract", id="multiply", id="divide".

User Story #4: My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a . (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding id="decimal".

User Story #5: My calculator should contain a clickable element with an id="clear".

User Story #6: My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding id="display".

User Story #7: At any time, pressing the clear button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of display.

User Story #8: As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of display.

User Story #9: In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of display.

User Story #10: When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.

User Story #11: When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.

User Story #12: I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.

User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).

User Story #14: Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.

User Story #15: My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).

Note On Calculator Logic: It should be noted that there are two main schools of thought on calculator input logic: immediate execution logic and formula logic. Our example utilizes formula logic and observes order of operation precedence, immediate execution does not. Either is acceptable, but please note that depending on which you choose, your calculator may yield different results than ours for certain equations (see below example). As long as your math can be verified by another production calculator, please do not consider this a bug.

EXAMPLE: 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 =

Immediate Execution Logic: 11.5
Formula/Expression Logic: 32.5

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
